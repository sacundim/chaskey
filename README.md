# The Chaskey Message Authentication Code, in Rust

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sacundim/chaskey.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sacundim/chaskey)

This is a Rust implementation of the
[Chaskey message authentication code](http://mouha.be/chaskey/).
Chaskey, which draws some inspiration and ideas from
[SipHash](https://131002.net/siphash/), has been designed to be a very
lightweight algorithm for use in microcontrollers.

## Disclaimer

While Chaskey is a cryptographic algorithm, the code in this repo:

1. Was written strictly as an **educational exercise**;
2. By a **non-cryptographer**;
3. Who is also a **beginner at Rust**.

Use entirely at your own risk!
